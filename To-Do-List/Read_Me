# To-Do List Application

## Overview
A simple command-line to-do list manager that allows you to track tasks, mark them as complete, and save your list between sessions. Built with Python and JSON for data storage.

## Features
- **Add new tasks** with descriptions
- **View all tasks** with completion status
- **Mark tasks as complete**
- **Persistent storage** using JSON
- **Simple menu-driven interface**

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. No additional dependencies required

## Usage
Run the application from the command line:
```bash
python to_do_list.py
```

### Menu Options
1. **View Tasks**: Shows all tasks with numbers and status
2. **Add Task**: Create a new to-do item
3. **Complete Task**: Mark a task as done by its number
4. **Exit**: Quit the application

## Data Storage
Tasks are automatically saved to `todo_list.json` in the same directory. The file format is:
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"description": "Task 1", "complete": false},
    {"description": "Task 2", "complete": true}
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling
- Handles invalid menu choices
- Validates task numbers when marking complete
- Gracefully handles missing/corrupted data files

## Customization
To modify the application:
- Change `file_name` in the script to use a different JSON file
- Adjust the task structure in `create_task()` to add more fields (e.g., due dates)
- Modify `view_task()` to change display formatting
