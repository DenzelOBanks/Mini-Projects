This Python script generates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. It allows customization of password length and the inclusion of numbers and special characters.

How It Works
Character Pool Generation:

Always includes uppercase and lowercase letters

Adds numbers (0-9) if requested

Adds special characters (!@#$%^&*, etc.) if requested

Password Generation:

Randomly selects characters from the pool

Continues until:
All requested character types are included

Minimum length requirement is met

Validation:
Ensures at least one number is included (if requested)

Ensures at least one special character is included (if requested)
